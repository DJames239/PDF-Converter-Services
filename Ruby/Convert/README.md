# Convert files to PDF using Ruby
The Ruby sample provided in this section uses the *[Muhimbi PDF Converter Services](http://www.muhimbi.com/Products/PDF-Converter-Services/summary.aspx)* to convert a file to PDF.  Additional sample code to convert, merge, watermark, secure and OCR files [can be found here](../).

A detailed blog post, including details about how to setup Ruby, including all prerequisites, can be found on our [Blog](http://blog.muhimbi.com/2013/03/use-ruby-on-rails-to-convert-merge-and.html).

:exclamation:
Please note that this example was written in the Ruby 1.8.7 / Rails 3.2.12 (2013) time-frame. Things have moved on since that time and you may find that for more recent Ruby versions you need a different Web Services Framework. However, the concept remains the same, you use a tool to generate proxy classes for the web service, then invoke those proxy classes from your Ruby code.
